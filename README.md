This is the old Webpack version. This version is not deployable as a server. This version is good for local play, it's faster for hot reloading than the new version.

npm install

npm run build

npm run server - just to run server at localhost:3000

npm run dev will run server and client - window should pop up at localhost:8080

Have fun making stuff!
